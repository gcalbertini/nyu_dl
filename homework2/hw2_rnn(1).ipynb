Let's say the input is a string 'abacaba', we want the model to not output anything for 3 steps (delay length), and then output the original string step by step, except the last 3 characters. So, target output is then 'XXXabac', where 'X' is empty output.\n","\n","This is similar to [this notebook](https://github.com/Atcold/pytorch-Deep-Learning/blob/master/09-echo_data.ipynb) (which you should refer to when doing this assignment), except we're working not with a binary string, but with a sequence of integers between 0 and some N.
